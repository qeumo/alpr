# Automatic Licence Plate Recognition
## About
This repository presents the result of the work of 12 teams on a task within the framework of the subject of deep machine learning in practice

## Team
* Dima - number on plate to text
* Rita - plate detection on image
* Pasha - car classification on image

## Pipeline
We consider images from the input stream with the most convenient frame rate for analysis. We process the received frames as follows: Initially, a car and its class and its license plate are detected on the frame. This license plate, by means of affine transformations, is brought to a working form. After that, the working section is binarized and fed to the "image-to-text" input of a convolutional recurrent neural network, which extracts text from the image and outputs it as a response.

## Change of ideas during working
Initially, after extracting the license plate and its binarization, it was planned to cluster the license plates on the board and their subsequent character-by-character classification. These plans had to be abandoned due to the need to process other objects that were clustered as a result of the work, and the need to add additional filters to extract only numbers from images

## Stack
* YOLÐž - for car and plate detection
* Convolutional-recurrent network for plate reading

## Plate detection and OCR

We use Russian plate Image Dataset from roboflow. Copy file 'data.yaml' from the dataset to folder '../yolo/data'
<br>`!cp "../yolov5/Russian-plate-1/data.yaml" "../yolov5/data"`

Add path to data.yaml with parameter --data
<br>`!python train.py --img 640 --batch 4 --epochs 20 --data data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --cache`

For plate recognition add path to the *.jpg, *.mp4 after parameter '--source'. After detecting cropped image will be save to '../run/exp/crop//
<br>`!python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640 --save-crop --conf 0.25 --source *.jpg`

For reading text from plate add cropped image path.

## Car detection and classification

For car classification task we fine-tuned yolov5 model from yolov5m.pt weights.
Vehicle classes: Car, Motorcycle, Truck, Bus, Bicycle

### Train
```
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 50 --data dataset.yaml --weights yolov5m.pt
```
You can check train summary at G.Drive link below

### Test
Training step gives us new weights which we further use for car classification
```
python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp12/weights/best.pt --source test_images/imtest13.JPG
```
Trained weights and dataset can be downloaded from G.Drive

## Project summary
The solution we have obtained is light enough to be run on a conventional CPU, however, in the case of an increase in the number of cameras, GPU involvement is required for parallel image processing.  
The work of the model in some parts of the work (the detection of the sign and the class of the car) showed good results, while in the field of image processing the results can be considered unsatisfactory. To improve the quality of recognition, we should increase the amount of data in the dataset and consider other models.
