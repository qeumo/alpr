## About
This repository presents the result of the work of 12 teams on a task within the framework of the subject of deep machine learning in practice

## Team
* Dima - number on plate to text
* Rita - plate detection on image
* Pasha - car classification on image

## Pipeline
We consider images from the input stream with the most convenient frame rate for analysis. We process the received frames as follows: Initially, a car and its class and its license plate are detected on the frame. This license plate, by means of affine transformations, is brought to a working form. After that, the working section is binarized and fed to the "image-to-text" input of a convolutional recurrent neural network, which extracts text from the image and outputs it as a response.

## Change of ideas during working
Initially, after extracting the license plate and its binarization, it was planned to cluster the license plates on the board and their subsequent character-by-character classification. These plans had to be abandoned due to the need to process other objects that were clustered as a result of the work, and the need to add additional filters to extract only numbers from images

## Stack
* YOLÐž - for car and plate detection
* Convolutional-recurrent network for plate reading

## Plate detection and OCR

We use Russian plate Image Dataset from roboflow. Copy file 'data.yaml' from the dataset to folder '../yolo/data'
`!cp "../yolov5/Russian-plate-1/data.yaml" "../yolov5/data"`

Add path to data.yaml with parameter --data
`!python train.py --img 640 --batch 4 --epochs 20 --data data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --cache`

For plate recognition add path to the *.jpg, *.mp4 after parameter '--source'. After detecting cropped image will be save to '../run/exp/crop//
`!python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640 --save-crop --conf 0.25 --source *.jpg`

For reading text from plate add cropped image path.
